##### Idea Behind This Web App
As someone who constantly seeks to learn new things and enhance efficiency in various aspects of life, I had the idea to create a web app that aligns with these principles.

This approach offers several advantages, including:

Sharper Focus on Immediate Tasks
Measurable Progress
Procrastination Prevention
